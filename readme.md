Usage:

To use the WebSocket client, you need to include the libwebsockets.h header file and link against the libwebsockets library. You can download and install the library from the libwebsockets website or through a package manager on your system.
The main function of the client should initialize the libwebsockets context and connection information using the lws_context_creation_info and lws_client_connect_info structures.
The client should also define a callback function that handles events triggered by the WebSocket connection, such as connection established, received data, and writeable state.
After creating a WebSocket client using the lws_client_connect_via_info function, the client should enter a loop that calls the lws_service function to handle events.
Finally, the context and client should be destroyed using the lws_context_destroy function.
Customization:

You can customize the WebSocket client in a number of ways, such as modifying the connection information, callback function, and message data.
The lws_client_connect_info structure allows you to specify various options, such as the URL scheme (ws:// or wss://), host name, port number, request path, and SSL options.
The callback function can be modified to handle different events, such as connection closed, error, and ping/pong.
The message data can be modified by changing the content, length, and message type passed to the lws_write function.
You can also set additional options for the WebSocket connection, such as the maximum message size, number of retries, and timeout values using the lws_set_timeout and lws_set_max_http_header_pool functions.
Overall, libwebsockets provides a flexible and powerful API for creating WebSocket clients in C, allowing you to customize the client to fit your specific requirements. However, it does require some knowledge of C programming and WebSocket protocols to use effectively.
